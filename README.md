## Description:

This project is a web application designed to visualize and analyze epidemiological data, focusing on disease reporting and outbreak patterns. By leveraging the capabilities of big data technologies and advanced statistical techniques, this application aims to enhance the understanding and management of public health trends. The project showcases an integration of frontend technologies such as React JS, HTML, and CSS with backend processing in PySpark and Python, demonstrating a comprehensive skill set in both data analysis and web development.

## Inspiration: 

Inspired by the potential of statistical techniques like hypothesis testing, regression, and dimensionality reduction (PCA) in addressing real-world challenges, this project aims to apply these methods to public health data. It serves as a platform to exhibit proficiency in web development and data analysis, illustrating how they can be combined to create accessible and impactful public health tools.

## Data Source:

The data utilized in this project is sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ensuring high reliability and accuracy for the analysis. This choice underlines the project's commitment to providing meaningful insights based on trustworthy data.

## Features:

Data Analysis and Visualization: Utilizes PySpark for in-depth analysis and Python with libraries such as geopandas for mapping disease outbreaks. The application visualizes these analyses through interactive dashboards developed with React JS, Plotly JavaScript, and other web technologies.

Advanced Statistical Techniques: Employs hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and PCA to uncover patterns and insights within the data, enhancing the application's ability to inform public health strategies.

Web Application: A user-friendly frontend developed with React JS, HTML, and CSS showcases the data visualizations and allows for intuitive interaction with the analysis results.

## Future Enhancements:

Plans include integrating a backend system for automatic data updates to keep the application current with minimal manual intervention.
